1.Create a shortcut

o/nithish www.nithish.com simple1,justformyref

nithish nithish www.nithish.com

o/nithish www.prethiv.com

it should throw an error saying that shortcut already exists.

2.List all the shortcut for a particular user

nithish  | nithish123

username | shortlink | description | full url 	 		| tagid						tagid| tags
nithish  | wwe       | wwe website | www.wwe.com 		| tagid=hash(username+shortlink)       	hash | wrestling

readFileSync
require

it caches the value so that every update done by requests will be in memory and also if you console log it
out it will be in a updated state

but readfilesync reads freshly everytime the call comes in
